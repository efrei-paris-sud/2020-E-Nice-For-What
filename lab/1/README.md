## Issues

Throughout this tp we hadn't encountered many problems. 
The only problem we had was with a faulty RGB LED in the last exercise.
  

## Conclusion 

This first lab of Internet Of Things was very interesting. It was the first time that we had the chance to discover all the compenents and learn about how it actually works.

What's also good is to be able to check in real life, whether our programs and our practical work is working.

## Introduction to Cloud 


The fourth lab of Internet of Things was about discovering a new component : ESP32. This board will help us to interact with internet in order to send data with its wifi and bluetooth functionnality.

# Issue : 

In this lab, our main issue was the last part with sending data over Thingspeak software. In fact, our board implementation was the wrong one. That's why it took us a long time to find our mistake.

# Conclusion

This lab has been for us one of the most interesting, because it approaches the use of the cloud in connected objects. 
It also inspired us for our IoT project about exchanging and retrieving data over the internet.
That's why finally, we are thinking of reusing this lab to help us in our future project.

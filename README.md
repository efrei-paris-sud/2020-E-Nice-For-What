# Project Name : Piano Uno

 **Description** : Piano Uno is a small piano that will work with an Arduino Uno. Basically, it's like a piano so you can play a song by pressing the different keys on the keyboard and it will produce a sound. Moreover, under the keyboard we will have some LEDs that will light up for each key pressed.
